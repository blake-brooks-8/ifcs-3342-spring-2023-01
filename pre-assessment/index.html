    <h2>My Assessment</h2> <!-- Hey Thomas! -->
    <p>The most important goal of effective communication is clarity. Clarity is not the same as simplicity . Often, simple things are clear if the message is intended to be brief and small, but often the message is about a complex relationship that can only be presented with a necessarily large amount of data. </p>
    <p class="alert">This complexity can be made to appear clear by effective organization and presentation and need not be reduced to meaningless "bite-sized" chunks of data, as simplification usually does. </p>
    <p>Clarity refers to the focus on one particular message or goal at a time, rather than attempting to accomplish too much at once. Simplicity is often responsible for the "dumbing" of information rather than the illumination of it.</p>
